        <h2>Investigating the Changes in Flux Density of Methanol Masers in the Orion Nebula</h2>
        <p>Mentor(s): Dr. Esteban Araya, Western Illinois University;</p>
        <p>Collaborator(s): Kenneth VanZuiden, Western Illinois University; Gabriel Sojka, Western Illinois University</p>
        <p>Abstract: The VLA Orion-A Large Survey (VOLS) collaboration used the Karl G. Jansky Very
        Large Array (VLA) telescope to observe a methanol maser in the Orion Nebula 20 times from
        April 3rd, 2022 to July 1st, 2022, corresponding to 20 different epochs of data. This study aimed
        to characterize this methanol maser in terms of flux density consistency, fast variability, and light
        wave polarization on both a short-term and long-term scale using these data, forming three
        objectives. The flux density was consistent for 17 epochs and inconsistent for 3 epochs based on
        the measurement errors, insinuating consistent calibration between pointings for most epochs.
        Within an epoch, the scans generally slightly differed in flux density over a 60-80 minute period,
        with mild evidence of fast variability in certain epochs. We saw no linear or circular polarization
        in any of the epochs. However, we saw many discrepancies in specific epochs such as offset
        pointing averages in epoch 2, an offset scan in epoch 3, negative sidelobes in a few epochs, and a
        software error in epoch 11. Through this study of multiple 2022 epochs, the maser’s behavior on
        a short time scale was analyzed more accurately than previous studies looking at epoch averages.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping New Systems for White Light Solar Flare Observation and Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Mentor(s): Dr. Corinne Brevik, Southern Illinois University Carbondale; Christopher Mandrell, Southern Illinois University Carbondale </p>
        <p>Abstract: White light solar flares are violent reconnection events of the Sun's magnetic field that
        can emit a wide range of the wavelengths of visible light. These flares can be powerful enough to
        create significant infrastructural disruptions due to their geomagnetic effects and thus are a focus
        of heliophysical research. This study details the composition and analysis of three days of solar
        data on June 9th, June 10th, and June 20th. We also describe the development of a new data
        collection system through automation of the observatory, along with the problems faced in both
        data collection and development. We found no white light solar flares on the days we took data,
        but white light solar flares occurred on June 17th and June 19th, illustrating the need for more
        consistent data collection systems to reduce the chance of missing a flare event. The
        development of more automated data collection systems means we can increase the efficiency of
        our observations and possibly observe more white light solar flares in future studies.<p>
